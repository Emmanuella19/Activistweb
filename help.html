    <p>Learning about Period Poverty has allowed me to become more appreciative of my priviledges because a lot of young girls don't have the luxury of accessing period products. Moreover, my time during the Period Club instilled in me the need to research more about this topic and inform as many people as I can. </p>

    <section>
        <dl>
            <dt class="whiskey"><b>1. Donate to your local women's shelter or online.</b></dt>
            <dd class="mom">Organizations like<a href="https://periodproject.org/">Periodproject</a>and<a href="https://www.actionaid.org.uk/our-work/womens-rights/period-poverty">actionaid</a>are actively working to donate surplus menstrual products to the communities they work in around the world.</dd>

            <dt class="whiskey"><b>2. Research period products you buy.</b></dt>
            <dd class="mom">I know it seems weird that this is a part of the solution but research can play a big role in the following: </dd>
            <dd>I. Ensuring the products meet safety standards and are made with quality materials to prevent health issues.</dd>
            <dd>II. Understanding the cost, availability, and accessibility of products, which affects period poverty.</dd>
            <dd>III. Considering the environmental effects of products, such as waste generation and sustainable materials.</dd>
            <dd>IV. Some products contain harmful chemicals; researching helps make informed choices.</dd>
            <dd class="mom">V. Research helps you support companies prioritizing accessibility, sustainability, and social responsibility.</dd>

            <dt class="whiskey"><b>3. Advocate for change</b></dt>
            <dd class="mom">Support policies that make menstrual products tax-free and accessible in public spaces, workplaces, and schools. You can lobby your elected officials to enact laws that ensure everyone has access to the period supplies they need. The<a href="https://allianceforperiodsupplies.org/tampon-tax/#:~:text=It's%20Time%20to-,End%20the%20Tampon%20Tax,the%20state%20legislators%20representing%20you.">Alliance for Period Supplies</a>offers tools and templates to help with community advocacy and contacting legislators.</dd>

            <dt class="whiskey"><b>4. Spread the word ðŸŒŽ</b></dt>
            <dd class="mom">Raise awareness about period poverty in your community. Involve your community, school, business, or faith-based organization to gather period supplies and raise awareness about period poverty. The most common misconceptions people have about Period Poverty is that it doesnâ€™t affect men and that trans people shouldnâ€™t be included in the cause. However, that's simply not true because we need all the support we can get to spread the cause!
