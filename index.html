    <p>Have you ever felt frustrated about the fact that feminine products like tampons, pads, period cups, etc. are priced even though women don't choose to bleed every month??!!</p>
  
    <p>I mean, let's ignore the fact that this phenomenon is absurd for a second and instead ask ourselves why these feminine products are outlandishly expensive.
    Well, this is because of a little something known as the<strong>Pink Tax.</strong> 
   Kilpinger Personal Finance describes the pink tax as "state sales tax on menstrual products, like tampons and feminine pads" (Taylor).</p>

    <p>The Pink Tax affects millions of women globally. A few examples of women who encounter this problem are:
    <dl class="yay">
        <dd>- Women in the military</dd>
        <dd>- Women in prison</dd>
        <dd>- Homeless women</dd>
        <dd>- Women in third-world countries</dd>
        <dd>- Trans women</dd>
    </dl></p>

    <p>Nonetheless, before I delve deeper into the topic of women's rights, I want to talk about my<a href="discovery.html"><strong>discovery</a></strong>of this fascinating topic.</p>
