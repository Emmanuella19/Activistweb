      <p>The<b>Gender Tax Repeal Act of 1995</b>was passed in California to prevent businesses from charging different prices for similar services based on gender. The term "pink tax" became popular around the same time to describe the practice of inflating prices for women's goods and services. The pink tax can be traced back to the early 20th century, when women paid more than men for everyday items like clothing and personal care products.</p>

      <p>Sale tax policies vary tremendously among the states. Some states do not tax any sales, some states offer a tax rebate for period products, some states have a lower tax rate, and some states have passed bills to exempt period products like other basic necessities. Fortunately, you can join to make these products more accessible and affordable for individuals across the U.S. by urging your elected officials to support legislation that would end the sales tax on menstrual products in your state. All you have to do is access<a href="https://actionnetwork.org/letters/its-time-to-end-the-tampon-tax">actionnetwork.org</a>to craft and send off a letter to your state legislator to end the tampon tax.</p>

      <h2><b>- Feminine Health for Homeless Women</b></h2>
      <dl>
        <dd>I. Homeless women may not have the financial means to purchase sanitary products like pads, tampons, or menstrual cups. This can lead to using makeshift and often unsafe alternatives, such as rags, paper towels, or even socks.</dd>
        <dd>II. Maintaining menstrual hygiene requires access to clean water and sanitation facilities, which are often not available to homeless women. This can lead to infections and other health issues.</dd>
        <dd>III. There is often a stigma associated with menstruation, and homeless women might feel ashamed or embarrassed to seek help or ask for menstrual products. This can exacerbate their isolation and mental health struggles.</dd>
        <dd>IV. Without proper menstrual hygiene, homeless women are at a higher risk of infections such as bacterial vaginosis and urinary tract infections. These health issues can be compounded by a lack of access to medical care.</dd>
        <dd>V. Period poverty can affect a homeless womanâ€™s ability to engage in daily activities, including seeking employment, attending school, or accessing services. The discomfort and stress of managing menstruation without proper resources can be debilitating.</dd>

      <h2><b>- Feminine Health in Prison</b></h2>
      <dl>
        <dd>I. In many prisons, women are given a limited supply of sanitary products, which may not be sufficient for their needs. They might have to purchase additional products from the prison commissary, which can be expensive.</dd>
        <dd>II. The sanitary products provided in prisons are often of low quality, which can lead to discomfort and health issues. Poor-quality products may not offer adequate absorption or protection.</dd>
        <dd>III. Access to clean water and private facilities to change sanitary products can be limited in prisons. This can make it difficult for incarcerated women to maintain proper menstrual hygiene.</dd>
        <dd>IV. Similar to homeless women, those in prison are at risk of infections and other health issues due to inadequate menstrual hygiene. The lack of timely medical care can exacerbate these problems.</dd>
        <dd>V. The prison environment often lacks privacy, and there can be stigma and embarrassment associated with menstruation. This can make it difficult for women to manage their periods with dignity.</dd>

      <h2><b>- Feminine Health for Women in Third-World Countries</b></h2>
      <dl>
        <dd>I. In many cultures, menstruation is surrounded by stigma and taboos, which can lead to shame and secrecy. This can prevent women from seeking help or discussing their menstrual health needs openly.</dd>
        <dd>II. Many third-world countries lack policies and government support aimed at addressing menstrual health and hygiene, leaving the issue largely unaddressed at the institutional level.</dd>
        <dd>III. Period poverty is often a reflection of broader gender inequalities. Women and girls may have less access to resources and decision-making power, which exacerbates the issue.</dd>
        <dd>IV. In some communities, there is limited support for women and girls dealing with period poverty, making it harder for them to find the help they need.</dd>
