  <p>I'm going to be 100% honest. Prior to my senior year of high school, I knew absolutely nothing about period poverty. I didn't know that war, famine, or even the location of a country can affect access to menstrual products. All I knew was that these products were expensive and they were annoyingly draining my pockets. It took me a while to come to terms with my privilege!</p>

  <p>Let's backtrack to a year ago, when seniors like me were looking to polish their college applications. School organizations, sports, and even popular clubs like the Debate Club attracted students in droves. I, on the other hand, wanted to join a club that was very niche and also stood for a good cause. I was very fortunate to come across the Period Club, and it changed my perspective of women's poverty immensely.</p>

    <p id="me">The Period Club opened my eyes to the immense problems that a lot of women face in having access to feminine products. I learned that items like pads, tampons, shaving sticks, etc. aren't accessible to certain females due to factors like stigma, the high cost of menstrual products, and a lack of water and sanitation facilities. These women then encounter hygienic issues like urinary tract infections and vulvar contact dermatitis. I was able to donate products to the local women's shelter in my community and also had the privilege of interacting with intelligent women who are working to spread awareness of period poverty.Â </p>
