This project is an activist website that touches upon period poverty amongst women. The basis for this project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript. I also used flexbox and media query for my images and video. 
Moreover, using Javascript, I was able to create a fact generator with eventlisteners and innerHTML.
Lastly, CSS was used to design the website from the font to the color scheme.
